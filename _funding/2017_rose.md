## Abstract

In post-industrial societies such as Finland the demand for welfare and health
services is growing strongly and health and welfare services cover the majority
of public expenditure. Service robots are believed to have great potential for
the area, increasing productivity and enabling quality improvements and new
business through novel services. The application area is nevertheless
challenging due to the centrality of ethical, legal and social issues.

ROSE project is a multidisciplinary study how advances in service robotics allow
product and service innovation and renewal of welfare services, when such
services are developed ethically and jointly with stakeholders. The development
is studied on individual, institutional and societal levels, taking into account
user needs, ethical issues, technological maturity, and the health care service
system.
