abstract: >
  In post-industrial societies such as Finland the demand for welfare and 
  health services is growing strongly and health and welfare services cover the 
  majority of public expenditure. Service robots are believed to have great 
  potential for the area, increasing productivity and enabling quality 
  improvements and new business through novel services. The application area is 
  nevertheless challenging due to the centrality of ethical, legal and social 
  issues.

  ROSE project is a multidisciplinary study how advances in service robotics 
  allow product and service innovation and renewal of welfare services, when 
  such services are developed ethically and jointly with stakeholders. The 
  development is studied on individual, institutional and societal levels, 
  taking into account user needs, ethical issues, technological maturity, and 
  the health care service system.
