  4-year research fellowship on multi-layer and semantic spatial representations
  for robotics
abstract: >
  Hypermaps improves how robots manage data about the environment they inhabit.
  The most common way for robots to handle environmental information is by using
  maps. At present, each different kind of data is hosted on a separate map.
  Similarly to how our use of maps have evolved from single-purpose maps
  (geographical, political, road map, etc.) to multi-layer maps (like Google
  Maps) which present us task-relevant information automatically, we propose a
  multi-layer mapping framework for robots. Hypermaps simplifies the way robots
  access maps and helps them correlate information from different maps. This
  enables robots to increase their ability to understand the world around them,
  perform more advanced tasks than what they can today, better understand user
  requests, and autonomously correct their knowledge about the environment. The
  research will be conducted in Aalto University, in collaboration with
  University of Bonn, Technical University of Munich, KONE ltd, and GIM
  Robotics.
