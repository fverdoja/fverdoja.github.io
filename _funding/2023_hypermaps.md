  Environmental awareness is a crucial skill for robotic systems intended to 
  autonomously navigate and interact with their surroundings.

  Robots access knowledge about their environment through maps. However, 
  currently we see a big “complexity gap” in robotic mapping: while in recent 
  years advances in computer vision have given us the ability to perceive our 
  surroundings like never before through object detection and people tracking, 
  robots still rely on maps containing only enough information for them to be 
  able to navigate, but insufficient for many other tasks required by advanced 
  autonomy. For example, most maps do not host semantic or dynamic information 
  about the environment, needed for any application where interaction with 
  people or specific objects is required. Until this gap is bridged, mobile 
  robots will not be able to operate autonomously in dynamic environments.

  Hypermaps lays the groundwork for the next level of interaction between robots
  and their environment by closing the complexity gap. In this project, we 
  propose to go beyond today’s multi-layer maps by a new formalism, called 
  hypermaps, where spatio-temporal knowledge (e.g., occupancy, semantics through
  deep object recognition, people movement in the environment) is stored and 
  processed through advanced artificial intelligence to offer the robot 
  task-specific maps to complete its missions. The core hypothesis of the 
  project is that such a formalism will leverage the interplay between different
  maps to extract even more information and allow deeper reasoning. Anomalies in
  one map will be detected and corrected by looking at its correlation with the 
  other maps, and information not visible in any single map will be made visible
  when the information of the layers is combined.

  Closing the complexity gap constitutes a fundamental step towards the 
  development of general, fully autonomous robots, able to execute high-level 
  tasks and interact with us and their environment.
