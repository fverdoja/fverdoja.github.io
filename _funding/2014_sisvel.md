abstract: >
  The first phase of standardization of the brand new MPEG coding technology, 
  HEVC, has just been completed. However, there is a significant need of new 
  coding techniques that can satisfy the requirements of future video 
  applications and services, e.g. ultra high definition and high frame rate 
  content and fully immersive multimedia experiences. Innovative image 
  segmentation and tracking tools are expected to play a significant role in the
  design of novel compression technologies in the era of ultra-high definition
  and high frame rate video content.
