abstract: >
  The SANTTU project focuses on the development of systems for operators of work
  machines and heavy industrial machines. The aim is to simplify the control and
  operation of the machines with semi-autonomous operator assistance systems.
  This can be used to reduce the cognitive stress on the operator as well as the
  stress on the machine, thus extending machine life, availability, and
  productivity. By combining physics-based (real-time) simulation, digital twins
  and artificial intelligence technologies - semi-automated systems can be
  created. We develop a model-based, AI-assisted solution that provides
  collision prevention, stress reduction, improved accuracy, automation of work
  routines, and a human-centric user interface design. These lower the
  competence requirements for the efficient use of the machine, which expands
  the realistically targeted market, especially in fast-growing market areas.
