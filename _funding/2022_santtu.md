## Abstract

The SANTTU project focuses on the development of systems for operators of work
machines and heavy industrial machines. The aim is to simplify the control and
operation of the machines with semi-autonomous operator assistance systems. This
can be used to reduce the cognitive stress on the operator as well as the stress
on the machine, thus extending machine life, availability, and productivity. By
combining physics-based (real-time) simulation, digital twins and artificial
intelligence technologies - semi-automated systems can be created. We develop a
model-based, AI-assisted solution that provides collision prevention, stress
reduction, improved accuracy, automation of work routines, and a human-centric
user interface design. These lower the competence requirements for the efficient
use of the machine, which expands the realistically targeted market, especially
in fast-growing market areas.
