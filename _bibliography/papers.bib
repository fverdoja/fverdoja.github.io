  abstract    = {In this paper a novel technique to segment tumor voxels in 
                 dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scans is proposed.
                 An innovative anomaly detection tool tailored for 3-points
                 dynamic PET scans is designed. The algorithm allows the
                 identification of tumoral cells in dynamic FDG-PET scans thanks
                 to their peculiar anaerobic metabolism experienced over time.
                 The proposed tool is preliminarily tested on a small dataset
                 showing promising performance as compared to the state of the
                 art in terms of both accuracy and classification errors.},

  abstract    = {Block-based compression tends to be inefficient when blocks 
                 contain arbitrary shaped discontinuities. Recently, graph-based
                 approaches have been proposed to address this issue, but the
                 cost of transmitting graph topology often overcome the gain of
                 such techniques. In this work we propose a new
                 Superpixel-driven Graph Transform (SDGT) that uses clusters of
                 superpixels, which have the ability to adhere nicely to edges
                 in the image, as coding blocks and computes inside these
                 homogeneously colored regions a graph transform which is
                 shape-adaptive. Doing so, only the borders of the regions and
                 the transform coefficients need to be transmitted, in place of
                 all the structure of the graph. The proposed method is finally
                 compared to DCT and the experimental results show how it is
                 able to outperform DCT both visually and in term of PSNR.},

  abstract    = {Image segmentation is one of the core task in image processing.
                 Traditionally such operation is performed starting from single
                 pixels requiring a significant amount of computations. Only
                 recently it has been shown that superpixels can be used to
                 improve segmentation performance. In this work we  propose a
                 novel superpixel-based hierarchical approach for image
                 segmentation that works by iteratively merging nodes of a
                 weighted undirected graph initialized with the superpixels
                 regions. Proper metrics to drive the regions merging are
                 proposed and experimentally validated using the standard
                 Berkeley Dataset. Our analysis shows that the proposed
                 algorithm runs faster than state of the art techniques while
                 providing accurate segmentation results both in terms of visual
                 and objective metrics.},

  abstract    = {Introduction: The aim of this work is to show the results of 
                 GTV automatic segmentation based on dynamic PET acquisition.
                 With respect to single voxel segmentation the temporal
                 information is used to improve quality of GTV delineation. The
                 segmentation algorithm proposed exploits the theoretic
                 assumption that FDG uptake over time in cancer cells is very
                 different from the one in normal tissues and therefore in this
                 study anomaly detection is used to look for tumor
                 peculiar-anomalous TACs. Material and Methods: For each patient
                 two list mode datasets of images were acquired. The first one
                 scan (basal) was acquired one hour after FDG injection and
                 reconstructed as static frame. The last one (delayed) was
                 acquired half one hour after the first scan and reconstructed
                 as dynamic scan. Two delayed scans were registered to the basal
                 scan. A modified version of the RX Detector was used. RX
                 Detector usually works in RGB, but in this study its use on
                 TACs has been explored passing the three grayscale images in
                 place of the three channels of RGB. The resulting single image,
                 which actually is a matrix of Mahalanobis distances, presents
                 values that are very high for voxels whose TAC has anomalous
                 temporal behavior. Finally, threshold segmentation is performed
                 on the distance matrix. On a dataset of 10 patients
                 segmentation techniques present in the literature working on
                 single PET scan have been implemented as well as segmentation
                 techniques based on RX Detector output. Results: Spatial
                 overlap index (SOI) was used as metric to evaluate the
                 segmentation accuracy. All of the segmentation algorithms
                 implemented on RXD output show better SOI (0.507 ± 0.158) than
                 algorithm based on SUV, i.e. Brambilla, SOI 0.278 ± 0.236. A
                 manual contour drawn by experienced Nuclear Physician was the
                 reference. Conclusion: Although a small dataset, the
                 segmentation of dynamic PET images based on RXD output seems to
                 be promising.},
