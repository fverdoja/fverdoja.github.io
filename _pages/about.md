Francesco Verdoja received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of
Turin, Italy in July 2017. After graduation, he joined the Intelligent Robotics
group at Aalto University in Helsinki, Finland, and worked part-time as AI
scientist for the AI consultancy company Silo AI, now part of AMD.

After receiving a personal Research Fellowship grant from the Research Council
of Finland for the [Hypermaps](funding/2023_hypermaps/) project in 2023, he now
works as academy research fellow in robotics at Aalto University. He also serves
as coordinator for the Aalto Robot Lab. His research focuses on robotic
perception and mapping with particular interest on increasing environment
understanding by extracting semantic knowledge from spatial representations. His
contributions include for example graph-based approaches to image segmentation
and compression, estimation of complete occupancy of objects from partial sensor
data, mapping the relationship between people flow and architecture, as well as
the formulation of hypermaps as next step beyond multi-layer mapping for
robotics.

Other achievements include three patents based on his research, the preparation
and management of two large scale Finnish national research projects, and the
organization of several workshops at top conferences in robotics.
