Francesco Verdoja received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of
Turin, Italy in July 2017. After graduation, he joined the Intelligent Robotics
group at Aalto University in Helsinki, Finland, and worked part-time as AI
Scientist for AMD Silo AI.

After receiving a personal Research Fellowship grant from the Research Council
of Finland for the [Hypermaps]({{ "/funding/2023_hypermaps/" | relative_url }})
project in 2023, he now works as Academy Research Fellow in robotics at Aalto
University. He also serves as coordinator for the Aalto Robot Lab. His research
focuses on robotic perception and mapping with particular interest on increasing
environment understanding by extracting semantic knowledge from spatial
representations. His contributions include for example graph-based approaches to
image segmentation and compression, estimation of complete occupancy of objects
from partial sensor data, mapping the relationship between people flow and
architecture, as well as the formulation of hypermaps as next step beyond
multi-layer mapping for robotics.

Other achievements include three patents based on his research, the preparation
and management of two large scale Finnish national research projects, and the
organization of several workshops at top conferences in robotics.
