Francesco Verdoja received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of
Turin, Italy, in 2017, specializing in graph-based approaches to image
processing. Following graduation, he joined the Intelligent Robotics group at
Aalto University in Helsinki, Finland, where he focused on robotic perception
and mapping. In addition to his academic role, Francesco worked part-time as a
Senior AI Scientist at AMD Silo AI, contributing to computer vision and machine
learning research and development.

Since 2023, he has held an Academy Research Fellow position, supported by a
Research Fellowship grant from the Research Council of Finland for his project
[Hypermaps]({{ "/funding/2023_hypermaps/" | relative_url }}), which aims to
address the complexity gap in robotic mapping through unified spatial, semantic,
and dynamic environment representations. At Aalto University, Francesco also
serves as Staff Scientist and coordinates the Aalto Robot Lab. His research
targets autonomous agents in physical spaces, with a focus on
representation-centric approaches that enhance environment understanding,
long-term operation, and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Francesco has published widely in leading robotics and AI venues, holds three
patents based on his research, and has secured substantial competitive funding
from national agencies and industry. He is an active member of the robotics
community, having organized workshops at IROS and ICRA, served as an associate
editor and reviewer for major conferences and journals. His work is driven by a
long-term vision of embodied AI systems that can operate robustly in complex
human-centric environments, grounded in principled models of perception,
representation, and interaction.
