Francesco Verdoja received his PhD in Computer Science from University of Turin,
Italy in July 2017. During his PhD studies his research focused on graph-based
image processing, with his work on tumor segmentation awarding him the "Best
student award" at the International Computer Vision Summer School 2014
(ICVSS14). Since September 2017 he joined the Intelligent Robotics group at
Aalto University in Helsinki, Finland as postdoctoral researcher. At the same
time, he was working part-time as AI scientist for the AI consultancy company
SiloAI.

Currently, he works as staff scientist in robotics in Aalto University. He is
the coordinator for the Aalto Robot Lab. His research focuses on robotic
perception and mapping with particular interest on increasing environment
understanding by extracting semantic knowledge from spatial representations. His
contributions include for example mapping complete occupancy of objects from
partial sensor data and estimating people flow from architecture, as well as the
formulation of the idea of hypermaps as next step beyond multi-layer mapping for
robotics.

Other achievements include three patents based on his research, the preparation
and management of two large scale Finnish national research projects, and the
organization of several workshops at top conferences in robotics.
