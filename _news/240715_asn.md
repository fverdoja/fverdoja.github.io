I am very happy to have received the National Scientific Habilitation
(Abilitazione Scientifica Nazionale, ASN, in Italian) by the Italian Ministry of
University and Research for the role of associate professor in Computer Science
(01/B1) and Computer Science Engineering (09/H1).

The habilitation is required to hold any Associate Professor position in public
Italian universities.
