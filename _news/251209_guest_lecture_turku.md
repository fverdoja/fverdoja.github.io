I was invited to give a guest lecture at University of Turku for the Robotics
Mapping course.

The lecture was titled "Semantic Mapping: From Segmentation to Scene Graphs" and
the slides from the lecture can be found [here]({{
"/assets/pdf/lectures/20251209_semantic_mapping.pdf" | relative_url }}).
