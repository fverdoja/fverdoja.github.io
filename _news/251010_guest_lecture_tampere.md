I was invited to give a guest lecture at Tampere University for the [Robotics
Project
Work](https://opiskelijanopas.tuni.fi/en/tampere-university/curriculum/course-units/tut-cu-g-47368?year=2025)
course.

The lecture was titled "Development practices from industry I still use in my
research" and material for the lecture (including a full video recording) can be
