I was just awarded an Academy Research Fellowship by the National Research
Council of Finland to work on my project _Hypermaps: closing the complexity gap
in robotic mapping_. The very competitive grant (15% acceptance rate) will cover
my work as the PI plus one PhD student for 4 years starting September 2023.

More info about the project can be found [here]({{ "funding/2023_hypermaps/" | relative_url }}).
